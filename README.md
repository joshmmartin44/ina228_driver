## INA228 Driver (code drop)

Bare-bones C++ driver for TI’s INA228 precision power monitor.
• Written for an internal nRF52 project, uses a thin neoI2C wrapper.
• Builds in SEGGER Embedded Studio; porting notes are in the header comments.

No guarantees. Pull requests welcome but I can’t promise merges.
